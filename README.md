Ada Analytics
=============

A light weight anonymous iOS analytics library. Access to the data collected is a shared between all members of the Ada Analytics Co-opertive.

## Aims

- Simple to incorporate. No code is required because it is loaded automaticly at runtime.
- Very low memory footprint. Any object should be released ASAP.
- Minimal network usage. Data payload should be as small as possible. 
- Anonymous. No users or app related data should be sent to the server.
- Minimal dependancies. The code should not depend on any 3rd pary framework or libary. However 1st party dependancies are used.
